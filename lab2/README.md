# Lab 2 - Linear Regression


* 20% of data goes to validation,
* 20% goes to test, and
* the remaining 60% goes to train.

```
y = g(x) = g(x1, x2, ..., xn) = w0 + x1 w1 + x2 w2 + ... + xn wn
```

Bias term is the value we would predict if we did not know anything about the car; it serves as a baseline.
